\section{Research Questions}
It is possible during the progress of the research project that we will split the research questions into a primary research question and secondary aspects to it.

\subsection*{Potential research questions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Do kids like the stories, i.e. is it possible to generate stories meaningful to kids, compared to childrenâ€™s literature.
    \item Do kids accept the product, in particular do they like how they can influence the story via variations of their pictures, markers, activity cards, etc.?
    \item Do kids understand AI? That it can make mistakes? Do they have fun using it?
  \end{itemize}
