Pre-defined set of animals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item fox
    \item owl
    \item spider
    \item cow
    \item elephant
  \end{itemize}

  Our targeted user group are children aged 6 to 12 years old. Therefore, we need the consent of their parents to be part of our evaluation audience for using our tool and answering a research questionnaire afterwards. Another additional condition regarding this user group is that the final story has to be in German. This can either be achieved by designing the tool to have a German output or by translating it to German afterwards. Additionally, the research group has to make sure that the AI generated content is child friendly and no offensive output is possible.
