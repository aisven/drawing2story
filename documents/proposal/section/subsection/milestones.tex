\subsection{Milestones}

\begin{itemize}
    \item three project phases aka. semesters
    \item m milestones per phase (1-to-1 relation between milestones and phases)
    \item ideally, each work package leads to one or more milestones
    \item ideally, each work package ends when all its milestones have been reached
    \item GANT diagram
    \item our work packages must be individually testable once done
    \item a work package may have measureable output (whichever applicable metrics), but this is optional
    \item Out-of-Scope: we do not need to add the resource planning
    \item Out-of-Scope: i.e. the estimation of work hours per work package is not in the proposal
\end{itemize}
