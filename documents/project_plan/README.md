# Install Latex

You will need a Latex editor e.g. MikTex, TexStudio,... (You might get errors because of uninstalled libraries)

Overleaf is a great online editor if you want to do quick editing. You can upload this latex folder to Overleaf and compile the file there.

# Editing

The main file to compile is the one end with .tex. Open this file, compile with the editor and you will get the pdf result.

I added a section folder with the .tex files for each section in our paper, just to easier to work on a specific section.
